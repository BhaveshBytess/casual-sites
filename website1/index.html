            <h2>Our Love, Our Story</h2>
            <p>In this universe of infinite possibilities, I found you. Through distance and time, our hearts connected in ways words fail to describe. In a world full of people, somehow, I found you—or maybe, you found me first.</p>
            <p>I was a man caged in a dark room, lost in shadows of my own mind, believing that was where I belonged. And you… you had walls so high, built over years, protecting a heart that had seen too much, felt too deeply. I once told you I would wait until you were ready to break them down yourself. I was wrong.</p>
            <p>Because in the end, it wasn’t just you breaking those walls, and it wasn’t just me waiting. It was both of us—standing on opposite sides, chipping away at the barriers, piece by piece, reaching for each other. You didn’t just open a door for me, you tore down the walls of my dark room, letting in a light I never thought I’d feel again. And I… I fought my way through to you, through the cracks in your walls, through the fears you never said out loud.</p>
            <p>Through your playful jealousy, your stubbornness, your softest words whispered when you think I’m asleep—you became my reason, my solace, my home.</p>
            <p>This space, this small part of the world, is a reflection of us—our love, our story, our moments that no one else will ever fully understand.</p>
            <p>Happy Birthday, my love.</p>
            <p>Even across miles, even through time, I am here. I am yours.</p>

                    <h1>Muskan – A Name, A Universe</h1>
        <p>Muskan… a name, a whisper, <br>
        <span class="highlight">A melody too soft for the world, but loud enough to echo in my soul.</span><br>
        A name that means <span class="highlight">smile</span>, yet carries storms within, <br>
        A name that lights up the world, yet hides in the shadows unseen.</p>
        
        <p>You weren’t just a name to me. <span class="highlight">You were a mystery.</span> <br>
        A girl behind walls so high, I thought I’d only ever admire them from afar. <br>
        A soul wrapped in layers of strength, <br>
        Yet fragile in the silence of her own thoughts.</p>
        
        <p>Who would have thought?<br>
        That <span class="highlight">the boy who forgot to smile</span> would fall for <span class="highlight">the girl named after one.</span><br>
        That after years of pretending, <br>
        <span class="highlight">His first real smile would be because of her.</span></p>
        
        <p>A boy who laughed loud, but lived in silence. <br>
        A boy who wore masks so well, even the mirror stopped recognizing him.<br>
        And a girl—<span class="highlight">a paradox.</span><br>
        A storm that calmed him, a chaos that made sense.<br>
        A heart too big for this world, yet too scared to show it.<br>
        She had walls <span class="highlight">taller than his pain</span>,<br>
        And he had shadows <span class="highlight">darker than her fears.</span></p>
        
        <p>I once believed I had to wait—<br>
        Wait for you to open up, to trust, to let me in.<br>
        But <span class="highlight">love isn’t about waiting.</span><br>
        <span class="highlight">It’s about breaking, rebuilding, holding on through the wreckage.</span><br>
        And so, as <span class="highlight">you chipped away at your walls,</span><br>
        <span class="highlight">I shattered the lock on my own cage.</span><br>
        We met not as perfect lovers, <br>
        <span class="highlight">But as two imperfect souls, choosing each other anyway.</span></p>
        
        <p>And Muskan...</p>
        
        <p>I know you say you hate this name, <br>
        That it carries pieces of a past you'd rather forget.<br>
        But <span class="highlight">Muskan isn’t just a name anymore.</span><br>
        It’s a story—<span class="highlight">our story.</span><br>
        It’s a boy who had lost everything, who had forgotten how to smile,<br>
        And the girl whose name meant "smile" but had forgotten how to believe in her own.<br>
        It’s two broken pieces fitting together,<br>
        Two hearts rewriting what was once painful into something beautiful.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">So don’t hate this name.</span><br>
        Because now, it belongs to <span class="highlight">the girl who saved me.</span><br>
        Now, it means home, warmth, and love.<br>
        It means a voice that could put me to sleep, a presence that keeps me sane,<br>
        A love that is chaotic, yet peaceful—<br>
        <span class="highlight">Like a storm that knows when to rain and when to rest.</span></p>
        
        <p>So, Muskan… my love, my universe, my storm, my calm.<br>
        This is not just your name.<br>
        <span class="highlight">It is everything you are to me.</span></p>

                    <p>As you open this letter on your special day, I want the universe to know how deeply you are loved. Your birthday isn't just a celebration of your existence – it's a celebration of all the lives you've touched, especially mine.</p>
                    <p>Your emotional depth amazes me daily. The way you feel everything so fully, so completely – it's taught me how to truly experience life. Your jealousy, always playful and adorable, reminds me how precious I am to you. Your romanticism ignites mine, making every moment feel like a scene from the most beautiful love story ever written.</p>
                    <p>Through moments of joy and challenge, your loyalty has been my foundation. You protect what you love fiercely, and I'm honored to be someone you hold dear. Your appreciation for beauty in the world – in music, in words, in little moments – continuously inspires me to see the magic that surrounds us.</p>
                    <p>I love how you find comfort in my presence, my words – because I find the same in you. Every song reminds me of you, every beautiful sight makes me wish you were there to see it too.</p>
                    <p>On this birthday, I want you to know that you're not just loved – you're cherished, treasured, and absolutely irreplaceable. Miles may separate us at times, but our hearts remain synchronized, beating as one across the cosmos.</p>
                    <p>Happy Birthday, my love. Here's to many more years of creating our love story across the stars.</p>
                    <p>Forever Yours,</p>
